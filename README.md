# gh - The GitHub CLI tool

The #ce-cli team is working on a publicly available CLI tool to reduce the friction between GitHub and one's local machine for people who use the command line primarily to interact with Git and GitHub. https://github.com/github/releases/issues/659

This tool is an endeavor separate from [github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub), which acts as a proxy to `git`, since our aim is to reimagine from scratch the kind of command line interface to GitHub that would serve our users' interests best.

## Process

1. For code we want to keep (production-ready), create PRs and merge them into `master`. For prototype code, merge them into the `prototype` branch since the code will most likely be throwaway.

2. Each week weâ€™ll have a tracking issue to coordinate plans and distribute the workload. They look like this https://github.com/github/gh-cli/labels/tracking%20issue.

3. We zoom as a team Tuesday fortnight
