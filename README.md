# Github Cli

The #ce-cli team is working on a CLI tool to reduce the friction between GitHub and your local machine for people who use the command line primarily to interact with Git and GitHub. https://github.com/github/releases/issues/659

## Process

1. For code we want to keep (production ready) create PRs and merge them into `master`. For prototype code we will merge them into the `prototype` branch because the code will most likely be garbage. We could have used one production and one prototype repo but that would have made communication more difficult and dispersed.

2. Each week weâ€™ll have a tracking issue to coordinate plans and distribute the workload. They look like this https://github.com/github/github-cli-prototype/labels/tracking%20issue. This issue can also be used for handoff messages like this https://github.slack.com/archives/C17LP0XU3/p1569378288317500. Using issues and a project board seems like overkill right now, so start lo-fi.

3. We zoom as a team fortnight (Tuesday)
