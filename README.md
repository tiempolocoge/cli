# gh - The GitHub CLI tool

The #ce-cli team is working on a publicly available CLI tool to reduce the friction between GitHub and one's local machine for people who use the command line primarily to interact with Git and GitHub. https://github.com/github/releases/issues/659

This tool is an endeavor separate from [github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub), which acts as a proxy to `git`, since our aim is to reimagine from scratch the kind of command line interface to GitHub that would serve our users' interests best.
