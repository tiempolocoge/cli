Moving forward, since we can open in the browser we need to discuss logic of arguments

This includes:
1. Open the repo in browser with just "gh browse"
2. Make the help instruction display while opening using IOStreams 
3. Find out how "cmd" stores args within, to be parsed
4. Make a table of all the possible inputs that are valid
5. Possibly work on error handling
6. Clarify table with client before moving forward with args
